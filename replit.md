# MojoTX Gambling Streamer Website

## Overview

MojoTX is a gambling streamer rewards platform built for the Kick.com streamer MojoTX. The application provides a comprehensive gamification system featuring monthly leaderboards, tiered level milestones, multiplier-based challenges, free spins offers, and a referral program. Users can track their progress, compete for prizes, and claim exclusive rewards through an admin-managed content system.

The platform is designed with a dark, high-energy aesthetic inspired by modern gambling platforms (Stake, Gamdom) and streaming services (Kick.com), emphasizing competitive elements, data clarity, and visual excitement through glowing effects and bold typography.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Tooling**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server, providing fast HMR and optimized production builds
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management, caching, and data synchronization

**UI Component System**
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI primitives, providing accessible, customizable components
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with a custom design system
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** for managing component variants
- Custom design tokens defined in CSS variables for colors, spacing, and effects (dark mode optimized)

**Design System**
- Dark theme with gambling/streaming platform aesthetics
- High-energy visual language with gradient effects, glowing borders, and elevated cards
- Typography hierarchy using Inter/Poppins for competitive data display
- Consistent spacing scale (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24px units)
- Responsive grid layouts for leaderboards, milestone cards, and challenges

**State Management Strategy**
- Server state managed via TanStack Query with optimistic updates
- Form state handled by React Hook Form with Zod validation
- UI state (modals, sidebar) managed locally with React hooks
- No global client state management library (Redux/Zustand) - intentionally kept simple

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- **Express.js** on Node.js for RESTful API endpoints
- TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack
- Custom middleware for request logging and JSON parsing
- Development mode uses Vite middleware for SSR and HMR

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints organized by feature domain:
  - `/api/leaderboard/*` - Leaderboard entries and settings
  - `/api/milestones/*` - Level milestone management
  - `/api/challenges/*` - Challenge CRUD operations
  - `/api/free-spins/*` - Free spins offer management
- Consistent response format with error handling
- Request validation using Zod schemas shared between client and server

**Data Layer**
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database queries and schema management
- Schema-first design with TypeScript inference for full type safety
- Storage abstraction layer (`storage.ts`) providing a clean interface for data operations
- Separation of concerns: routes → storage → database

**Database Seeding**
- Automatic database seeding on startup for initial data (level milestones, sample entries)
- Idempotent seed logic that checks for existing data before inserting
- Milestone data pre-populated with 24 tier levels (Bronze through Opal)

### Data Storage

**Database Technology**
- **Neon Serverless PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- WebSocket-based connection pooling for serverless environments
- Environment-based configuration via `DATABASE_URL`

**Schema Design**
- **leaderboard_entries**: Tracks user rankings, wagered amounts, and prize allocations
- **leaderboard_settings**: Stores monthly competition configuration (prize pool, end date)
- **level_milestones**: Defines the 24-tier progression system with rewards
- **challenges**: Manages multiplier-based game challenges with requirements
- **free_spins_offers**: Tracks promotional offers with claim limits and expiration

**Data Model Characteristics**
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Decimal type for monetary values (precision 15, scale 2) ensuring accurate financial calculations
- Timestamp tracking for creation and updates
- Array fields for storing multiple rewards per milestone
- Boolean flags for active/inactive state management

### External Dependencies

**Third-Party Services**

- **Lucide React** - Icon library for consistent iconography
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **Embla Carousel** - Touch-friendly carousel component

**Development Tools**
